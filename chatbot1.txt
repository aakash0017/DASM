Try to give your best in the present becaouse woorying aboput futre didnt give you anything , 
you have your present in your control.
Small steps each day , help you to reach your goal. 

Live in the present, and try to give your best in it. You won't achieve anything by worrying about the future.
However, you have your present in your control, ultimately making you the creator of your own destiny.
Start with something small, perhaps. Even little steps will eventually lead you to your goal.
