if you are worrying too much about your past or future , it will fill up your thoughts by this things , 
which stops you to focus on your present, so
diclater yourself by doing some physical activites and some physical exercise and playing physical games.







If you worry too much about your past or future, that may restrict you from focussing on your present 
as your head will be pre-occupied with random thoughts.

So yeah, keep yourself busy by doing physical activities and exercises.
