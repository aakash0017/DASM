all of us are unique and diff. and we are not handeled and diff. so we 
have to accept that we all are diff
. and we cannot rely on other persons likes and dislikes.






Every individual on this planet is unique and different from one another. Thinking too much about others' 
opinions on you would be pointless. We all have different things that we like or dislike. It's all a matter of
personal preference.
