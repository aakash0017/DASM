## Depression Anxiety and Stress Management System

Mental health is often ignored and people are afraid of asking for help. College students, who go through a tremendous amount of stress throughout the year, sometimes need assistance.  DASM was built keeping this in mind.

DASM is an anonymous online assistant that can help students who may face any difficulty regarding their mental health. The data were anonymously collected and labeled using a professional psychologist. 

The multi-Level classification technique is used to provide the best solution possible.
